### Internship Test

### ReactJS Developer Profile Set-1

### Guidelines:
 Please follow the following pointers while doing the assignment: 
1. Assignment duration: 1 day(we expect the assignment in full) 
2. Attach a Readme to your code 
3. Use react router for routing 
4. Use redux for state management 
5. UI and functionality :
○ Add login/signup to your portal with minimal but relevant login details 
○ Use localstorage/sessionstorage to maintain the session for a logged in user 
○ Create a landing page with a single input asking the user what programming language they’re looking for a job in. 
○ Once the user chooses a language, make a request to the Github public API searching for jobs that require developers who know said language. 
○ Show the user a list of jobs with an option to view them in detail. 
○ Once the user selects a job posting, make another request to the API to fetch that particular job. 
○ Add another page to view that particular job and provide an option to apply. 
○ Upon clicking apply, show the user a form asking them for the following: 
■ Name 
■ Email 
■ Cover Letter Note 
■ A file upload for resume, cover letter etc would be a plus 

○ When the user submits the form, show them a success page with a preview of what their application looks like. 
○ There is no API request involved in showing the success page, you just have to transfer the data within the app. Use state management for this. 
○ The design of the page, validations, rules etc are left up to you but we expect all in place
